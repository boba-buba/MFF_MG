# Peníze

### co to jsou peníze, tisk peněz, inflace
- **Fiat měny**: Měna s nuceným oběhem či peníze s nuceným oběhem jsou peníze vytvořené mocí úřední,[1] tedy takové peníze, jejichž hodnota je stanovena zákonem. Měna s nuceným oběhem se objevuje i pod názvy zákonná měna, fiat měna (obdobně fiat peníze), kde slovo fiat je ve významu rozkaz či nařízení (v angličtině) nebo budiž tak (v latině). Měna s nuceným oběhem je zákonné platidlo, neboť jí lze splácet úvěry a finanční obligace. Mezi měny s nuceným oběhem patří všechny současné státní/národní měny.

- **Inflace**: nárůst všeobecné cenové hladiny zboží a služeb v ekonomice v určitém časovém období. Ekvivalentně lze inflaci definovat jako snížení kupní síly neboli hodnoty peněz, ale fakticky se jedná o důsledek inflace, nikoliv její definici. Změnu cenové hladiny za určité období udává míra inflace, která se vypočítává jako poměr vybraného cenového indexu na konci a na začátku měřeného období. Nejpoužívanějšími cenovými indexy jsou index spotřebitelských cen, index cen výrobců a deflátor HDP.

Central banks issue and regulate Fiat money, which controls its supply through monetary policy tools such as interest rates and quantitative easing. This centralized control allows governments to respond to economic fluctuations by adjusting the money supply, but it also introduces inflation and devaluation risks.

An emerging evolution of fiat is the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), a digital version of a country’s official currency. As of 2025, over 90% of central banks were exploring or piloting CBDCs, aiming to modernize payment systems and compete with decentralized cryptocurrencies.

### motivace pro bitcoin

**Bitcoin** is a decentralized digital currency that runs on blockchain, a distributed ledger maintained by a network of computers (nodes) worldwide. Unlike centralized banking systems, blockchain records all transactions publicly and immutably, ensuring transparency and security.

At its core, Bitcoin’s blockchain uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW), where miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the chain. This trustless, peer-to-peer system eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks while preventing double-spending and fraud.

One of Bitcoin’s defining features is its fixed supply. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist. This scarcity is enforced through its protocol, and Bitcoin is often compared to digital gold.

Bitcoins are introduced into circulation through mining, where participants (miners) compete to solve cryptographic puzzles. Successful miners are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins and transaction fees. Over time, the reward halves approximately every four years – a process called the halving, which gradually slows the rate of supply growth and contributes to its deflationary nature.

### ETF
**Burzovně obchodovaný fond** (angl. exchange-traded fund, zkráceně ETF) je podobně jako akcie snadno dostupný investiční nástroj kapitálového trhu, který vytvářejí a spravují specializované finanční instituce.

- How ETFs Are Connected to Fiat Currencies

ETFs exist inside the fiat financial system.

- Fiat connection points

1. Pricing: ETFs are priced in fiat (USD, EUR, etc.)

2. Settlement: Trades settle through banks, clearing houses, and brokers

3. Liquidity: Market makers inject fiat liquidity

4. Regulation: ETFs operate under government financial regulators (SEC, ESMA, etc.)

- Creation & Redemption (Important)

ETF shares are created or destroyed through Authorized Participants (APs):

1. AP deposits fiat or assets

2. ETF issuer creates shares

3. Shares are traded on exchanges

4. This mechanism keeps ETF price close to the underlying asset

➡️ This system only works because of fiat-based banking rails.

- Types of Bitcoin ETFs
1. Bitcoin Futures ETF

    - Does not hold Bitcoin

    - Holds Bitcoin futures contracts (CME)

    - Fully fiat-derivative based

    - Higher tracking error and costs

This is Bitcoin exposure without Bitcoin.

2. Spot Bitcoin ETF (the important one)

    - ETF actually holds Bitcoin

    - Bitcoin is held by a custodian (e.g., Coinbase Custody)

    - Shares represent indirect ownership of real BTC

This connects fiat capital directly to real Bitcoin demand.

- Think of Bitcoin as:

A distributed database with:

    - Immutable ledger

    - Deterministic monetary policy

    - Native settlement layer

An ETF is like:

    - A centralized API wrapper

    - That exposes Bitcoin’s price to legacy systems

    - But hides its true capabilities (self-custody, censorship resistance)

### KYC/NonKYC
**KYC** = “Know Your Customer”

It is a legal and regulatory requirement that forces financial institutions to identify and verify their users.

- What KYC usually requires: Full legal name, Government ID (passport, ID card), Address,Sometimes: Source of funds, Income proof, Facial scan / biometrics.

- Who must do KYC: Banks, Stock brokers, ETF providers, Crypto exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc.), Payment processors.

Why KYC exists (official reason): Prevent money laundering, Prevent terrorism financing, Prevent fraud, Enforce sanctions and tax compliance.

📌 Key idea:
KYC ties money to identity.

- Fiat + KYC = Total financial visibility

Because fiat flows through intermediaries: Every transaction can be monitored, Accounts can be frozen, Funds can be seized, Spending can be restricted.

Banks are legally required to: Report suspicious activity, Share data with governments, Block transactions without explanation.

📌 Important:
You don’t own fiat in a bank — you have a permissioned claim on it.

**Non-KYC** means using money systems without mandatory identity disclosure.

Historically: Cash is non-KYC, Gold is non-KYC, Physical bearer instruments are non-KYC.

In crypto context Non-KYC means: No ID, No account, No permission, No centralized intermediary.

📌 Non-KYC = bearer money
Whoever controls it, owns it.

- Bitcoin itself is Non-KYC by design: No identity layer, No registration, No central authority, No approval required. Anyone can: Generate a wallet, Receive Bitcoin, Send Bitcoin. Bitcoin uses: Public keys, not names; Cryptography, not trust; 

📌 Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous: Addresses are visible, Identities are not natively attached

### MiCA, DORA
**MiCA** = Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation

It is the first comprehensive crypto regulatory framework in the EU, adopted in 2023 and phased into force in 2024–2025.

MiCA aims to: Regulate crypto asset issuers, Regulate crypto service providers, Protect consumers, Preserve financial stability

📌 Important:
MiCA regulates companies and intermediaries, not the Bitcoin protocol itself.

MiCA applies to Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs), such as: Centralized exchanges, Brokers, Custodians, Stablecoin issuers, Wallet providers (custodial).

Key requirements: Mandatory licensing, Mandatory KYC/AML, Transaction monitoring, Whitepapers for token issuance, Capital requirements, Reporting obligations.

📌 If a company touches fiat ↔ crypto, MiCA applies.


**DORA** = Digital Operational Resilience Act

DORA is not crypto-specific. It applies to all financial entities, including crypto companies. Official purpose: Prevent system outages, Prevent cyberattacks, Prevent IT failures, Ensure continuity of financial services.

Who must comply: Banks, Payment providers, Investment firms, Crypto service providers (CASPs), Cloud providers serving finance.

he Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is a regulation introduced by the European Union to strengthen the digital resilience of financial entities. It entered into application on 17 Jan 2025 and ensures that banks, insurance companies, investment firms and other financial entities can withstand, respond to, and recover from ICT (Information and Communication Technology) disruptions, such as cyberattacks or system failures.


- MiCA regulates crypto markets and companies

- DORA regulates technical resilience

Both apply to intermediaries, Neither can control Bitcoin protocol.

Bitcoin remains: Permissionless, Borderless, Self-custodial.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Pros of Bitcoin

- Scarcity & Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin holds ~40–50% of the total crypto market cap in 2025, and with its fixed supply of 21 million, Bitcoin, like gold, hedges against inflation and currency devaluation.
- Borderless Transfers: Bitcoin enables fast, low-barrier cross-border payments without relying on banks or remittance services, which is especially valuable in regions with weak financial infrastructure.
- Censorship Resistance: Decentralization and pseudonymity make it harder for governments or other entities to block or confiscate funds than traditional bank accounts.

#### Cons of Bitcoin

- Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, which makes it unreliable for everyday transactions and challenging as a stable store of value in the short term.
- Regulatory Uncertainty: Legal status varies worldwide, and future regulations could impact its use or value.
- Technical Complexity: Using and securely storing Bitcoin requires technical knowledge, and mistakes (like losing private keys) can result in irretrievable loss.

#### Pros of Fiat Money

- Stability: Fiat currencies are designed to remain relatively stable, making them suitable for everyday transactions and pricing goods and services.
- Universal Acceptance: As legal tender, fiat is widely accepted and trusted for both domestic and international trade.
- Legal Protections: Transactions and deposits in regulated banking systems are often insured and protected against fraud.

#### Cons of Fiat Money

- Inflation Risk: Central banks can expand the money supply at will, potentially leading to inflation and loss of purchasing power.
- Central Control: Users depend on the government and banks, which may impose capital controls, freeze accounts, or misuse monetary policy.
- Potential Devaluation: Poor fiscal management or crises can lead to sharp devaluation or, in extreme cases, currency collapse.
